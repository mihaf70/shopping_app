# Shopping App

Shopping app is a tool where you can kepp the list of products that you want to buy.

## Getting started

This app is dedicated to Android devices (not every functionality will work on iOS)

## Prerequisites
The app is and expo project, so to run it you must have Android device with expo app on it. If you don't have one you can use Android emulator.
Here is the guide how to install and configure it: <https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/> 

## Running the app

At first you need to download Node.js from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

Then in terminal type (on IOs and Linux you might need to add "sudo" in front of the command):
```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

In your code editor (for example Visual Studio Code) open terminal and type:
```
npm install expo
```

And then to run your project:
```
npm start
```
Project will be opened in web browser and you'll have three launch options:
* on device - you will need to scan QR code in Expo app (most recommended by me)
* on emulator
* on web browser
## Build with
* Typescript  <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>
* React Native <https://reactnative.dev/>
